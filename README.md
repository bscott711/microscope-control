A Python-based desktop application for controlling a custom Oblique Plane Microscope (OPM) using an ASI Tiger controller. This project features a robust, modular architecture and a graphical user interface for running hardware-timed imaging sequences with live viewing, real-time scrubbing, and calibrated data saving.

## **‚ú® Key Features**

This application has been refactored to provide a stable and extensible platform for microscope control.

* **Modular Architecture**: Code is cleanly separated into Model, View, Controller, and Hardware layers, making it easy to maintain and extend.  
* **Hardware-Timed Acquisitions**: Executes time-lapse Z-stacks with precise timing managed by the ASI PLogic card.  
* **Live Viewing with Scrubbing**: View incoming frames in real-time and scrub through the data buffer during an active acquisition without interrupting data collection.  
* **Responsive, Thread-Safe Operations**: All long-running acquisitions are performed in a background thread to ensure the GUI remains responsive at all times.  
* **Intelligent Configuration**: The system automatically determines timing parameters based on the user-defined useq acquisition sequence.  
* **Calibrated OME-TIFF Saving**: Optionally save data as multi-page OME-TIFF stacks, now with comprehensive useq sequence metadata and per-frame hardware metadata saved as JSON sidecar files.  
* **Configuration Profiles**: Easily switch between different hardware configurations (e.g., a real system and a demo setup) using simple command-line arguments.  
* **Graceful Cancellation**: A responsive "Cancel" button allows for the safe and immediate termination of a running acquisition.

### **üöÄ Getting Started**

#### **Installation**

This project uses uv for fast package management.

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone <https://github.com/bscott711/microscope-control.git>  
   cd microscope-control

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**  
   \# Create the virtual environment  
   python \-m venv .venv

   \# Activate the environment (macOS/Linux)  
   source .venv/bin/activate

   \# On Windows, use: .venv\\Scripts\\activate

   \# Install the project in editable mode with uv  
   uv pip install \-e .\[dev\]

#### **Running the Application**

The application is launched using the uscope command-line entry point. You can specify a hardware profile to use.

* **To run with the real hardware:**  
  uscope \--config hardware\_profiles/default\_config.yml

* **To run in Demo Mode (no hardware required):**  
  uscope \--config hardware\_profiles/demo\_config.yml
