## ‚ú® Key Features

This application provides a solid foundation for OPM control with the following features implemented:

* **Live Image Display:** A real-time camera feed displayed in the GUI.
* **Snap Image:** Acquire a single frame with the current settings.
* **Automated Time-Lapse Z-Stack:** Configure and run sequences with multiple Z-stacks over time.
* **Intelligent Timing Control:** Set time intervals between volumes or run at the maximum possible speed.
* **Real-time Estimates:** The UI provides instant feedback on camera exposure, minimum volume time, and total acquisition duration.
* **Calibrated OME-TIFF Saving:** Optionally save data as multi-page OME-TIFF stacks with `ZYX` dimensional metadata.
* **Graceful Cancellation:** A responsive "Cancel" button allows for the safe and immediate termination of a running acquisition.
* **Demo Mode:** Run the application without any physical hardware for testing and development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

This project uses `uv` for fast package management.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bscott711/microscope-control.git](https://github.com/bscott711/microscope-control.git)
    cd microscope-control
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install the project in editable mode with uv
    uv pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

### Running the Application

* **With real hardware:**
    Make sure your hardware configuration file is correctly specified in `src/microscope/config.py`. Then, run:

    ```bash
    microscope-control
    ```

* **In Demo Mode (no hardware required):**
    Use the `MICROSCOPE_DEMO` environment variable.

    **On macOS/Linux:**

    ```bash
    arch -x86_64 zsh
    source .venv/bin/activate  
    MICROSCOPE_DEMO=1 microscope-control
    ```

    **On Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    $env:MICROSCOPE_DEMO="1"
    microscope-control
    ```
